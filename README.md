Cutting Patterns for Surface Duo Skins.

Files for use to cut a vinyl skin for a Microsoft Surface Duo.

I used a Cricut Maker with Cricut brand vinyl.  Not an endorsement, just a record of materials/methods.

They were made in illustrator, but exported to SVG which is the format you can import into the Cricut Design Studio.  I think it should work with other cutters as well.

In these SVGs there is a bounding box that is the same size as the canvas.  That is because for whatever reason when I import SVGs into Cricut Design Studio, it scales them such that the largest element is the same height as the canvas.

In order to maintain scale, I add a bounding box vector which is the same size as the canvas.

If your software is not broken in the same way that Cricut Design Studio is, then you can delete this box.

My first attempt came out a bit too big after I peeled and kinda squeegeed it to get rid of the bubbles, since it stretched a bit.  I also added cutouts for the shiny windows logo.  The vector is not a compound path, you'll have to "attach" them together while using cricut studio.  I did this because I had a plan of doing an inlay, which would mean I need to cut the negative space as positive space from another color.

Even if you just want to leave the cutouts as open space, this way it's more flexible.  You can attach them, or you can also delete them if you don't want the cut out.

You can also add in a different pattern and cut out something different.  I was going to do lala, but I changed my mind.  All the stuff I craft is usually lala based, but on second thought, it doesn't make sense on my surface duo.  I left it in on the SVG as an example of some possibilities.  If you do the cutout, it might be better to make the positive cutout a smidgen smaller to they don't overlap.

So that's a TODO: Shrink the positive inlays.
