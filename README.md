Cutting Patterns for Surface Duo Skins
Files for use to cut a vinyl skin for a Microsoft Surface Duo.

They were made in illustrator, but exported to SVG which is the format you can import into the Cricut Design Studio.  I think it should work with other cutters as well.


They are SVGs and I use a Cricut Maker with Cricut brand vinyl.  Not an endorsement, just a record of materials/methods.
